# ASLR Bypasses

This is one of a Lab module from MIT's Secure Hardware Design.

In this we are required to leak the ASLR with different approaches, with the concept of egghunter, prefetch side channel attack and speculative probling.  
Then we are required to perform code reuse attack(ROP) to exploit the program.
