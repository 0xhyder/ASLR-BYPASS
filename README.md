# ASLR Bypasses

## Secure Hardware Design – MIT Lab Module
[Link](https://csg.csail.mit.edu/6.S983/labs/aslr/)

This lab explores several microarchitectural and memory-safety techniques used to defeat Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
we will implement three different ASLR-leaking strategies and then use the leaked address to perform a code-reuse (ROP) attack. 

## Part1A 
In this part, we are required to impliment the egghunter mechanism to bypass ALSR.

## Part1b 
In this part, we are required to perform prefetch side channel attack to defeat ASLR.

## Part1c
In this part, we are required to perform Speculative Probing to defeat ASLR.

## Part2
In this part, we need to construct ROP chain to call a WIN function.

## Part3
This is a final part where, we need to perform both ASLR BYPASS with ROP to exploit.
